# 0.0.1 release checks

Evaluated runtime: `ed5248238b1f88d06cb76e9bfa6427e09567f743`.
Package and module versions agree at 0.0.1. This release includes bounded aliases;
read-only permission increases still suggest review. The v0.0.0 tag is unchanged.

- [Candidate CI](https://github.com/adi271213/workflow-privilege-check/actions/runs/40223223486)
  passed 127 tests on each Python 3.11–3.14 and eight disconnected-network outcomes.
- [Hosted contract](https://github.com/adi271213/workflow-privilege-check/actions/runs/40223221809)
  passed all 20 jobs, including complete, incomplete, error, missing input,
  supported aliases, partial secrets and Git provenance regressions in both modes.
- Six consumer PR cases below passed in both modes (12 outcomes). Logs verified
  the downloaded SHA, exact input commits, read-only permissions, rule facts,
  report consistency and expected advisory/require-complete step outcomes.
- The wheel installed into a fresh environment without an index; the source
  distribution rebuilt and installed without an index. The installed CLI retained
  both token findings in aliased jobs and package/module metadata agreed.
- All 74 hash-verified historical reports are unchanged; all 45 labeled legacy
  facts remain, with 62 complete / 12 incomplete reports. This selected,
  self-labeled replay is not production precision/recall.

The earlier [21-case alias packet](ALIAS-VALIDATION.md) covers graph limits,
cycles, alias equivalence to inline YAML and independent retained findings.
The release changes version/docs; alias rules and limits are preserved.
After the final main CI passes, the new tag is checked through a consumer
installation before the release/Marketplace listing is published. That run is
recorded in the [release notes](https://github.com/adi271213/workflow-privilege-check/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

Invalid fixture files can also receive GitHub's own validation failures; listed
consumer jobs verify the analyzer's independent handling of their data. Fixtures
are never dispatched or merged. No new fork or independent human security audit
is claimed. No maintainer invitations have been sent.
