# Install Workflow Privilege Check

Use one public repository you maintain that already runs GitHub Actions. Keep
ordinary review and existing scanners. This tool reports configured changes;
it does not approve PRs or enforce human review. Leave the job outside required
merge checks and auto-merge authorization during initial evaluation.

## Installation

Copy [the complete workflow](examples/github-action-template.yml) to
`.github/workflows/workflow-privilege-review.yml` in your repository. Its Action
step is already pinned to this evaluated source:

```text
adi271213/workflow-privilege-check@ed5248238b1f88d06cb76e9bfa6427e09567f743
```

Keep `mode: advisory`, `contents: read`, the trusted-base checkout, exact head
fetch and result-explanation step. Review the copied workflow before merging it.
The recipe uses Linux GitHub-hosted runners with Python 3.11+ and Git. It needs
no repository secrets, cloud credentials, write token, or extra account.
The verified PyYAML bundle is included; no pip/venv/download runs during analysis.
Downloading Actions and fetching public commits still require network access.
Private-repository authentication and arbitrary self-hosted installations are not
covered by this setup recipe. Do not broaden permissions to force installation.

The calling workflow remains editable in PRs. Pinning the scanner does not make
that calling workflow an unbypassable boundary. Normal fork approval rules apply;
current-version fork validation is limited to the explicitly linked release tests.

## Two onboarding checks

After installation reaches the default branch:

1. Open a README-only PR. Expect `complete / none / 0 findings` and analysis exit 0.
2. In a separate PR add the unused workflow below as
   `.github/workflows/pilot-read-grant.yml`. Expect `complete / suggested`, one
   WF001 finding and analysis exit 0. Do not dispatch or merge this fixture;
   inspect the summary and close the PR.

```yaml
name: Pilot read-grant fixture
on: workflow_dispatch
permissions: {}
jobs:
  fixture:
    permissions:
      contents: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Manual pilot fixture"
```

Record both run URLs. If results differ, inspect the diagnostic and report the
public PR/run links. Never invent token defaults or add write access for the test.

## Interpret the outputs

| Analysis / review | Meaning |
|---|---|
| complete / none | No supported configured change was found; continue ordinary review |
| complete / suggested | Inspect the intended token/trigger/secret/context changes |
| incomplete / unknown | Missing context; zero findings is not a clean result |
| incomplete or error / suggested | Inspect known findings and unresolved parts |
| error / unknown | Input or analysis failed; inspect the diagnostic |
| failed step / missing outputs | Execution or report publication did not finish |

Advisory mode can succeed with incomplete/error analysis. Default
`require-complete` fails those states, but **neither mode fails just because
findings exist**. A required status alone does not require approval of grants.
[README](README.md#outcomes) separates these outcomes from CLI exits.

Outputs are `analysis-status`, `review-status`, `finding-count`,
`analysis-exit-code`, `report-path`, `summary-path`, `base-sha` and `head-sha`.
JSON/Markdown reports stay in the GitHub job logs/summary and job-local files;
no PR comments, telemetry or external reporting service are used.

## Coverage and feedback

See [validation](VALIDATION.md), [trigger policy](docs/TRIGGER-POLICY.md),
[runner/environment policy](docs/CONTEXT-POLICY.md) and [YAML policy](docs/YAML-POLICY.md).
The installation pin above contains the 0.0.1 runtime, including bounded aliases.
The original `v0.0.0` tag remains unchanged and rejects aliases.
For the optional advisory trial, see [PILOT.md](PILOT.md). No production
precision/recall or independent human security audit is claimed.
